This is a low level design for menu.c 

Pseudo code for main function 

	1. create a infinite loop
	2. Display choices of menu  
	3. Get input of the choices from the user 
	4. Check the choices 
		If choice is 1 read the value from user for assigning in array and call insert function with input as argument passed  
		If choice is 2 call delete function 
		If choice is 3 call display function 
		If choice is 4 terminate the program come out of infinate loop 
	5. If the choice is other than 4 continue with the infinite loop
